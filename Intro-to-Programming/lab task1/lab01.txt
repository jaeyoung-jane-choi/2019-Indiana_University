Estimated answer: Hello world

I thought that I would get a result of Hello World, but didn’t get any result! I found out because I first inputed just ‘hello world’ After some time, I found out that I didn’t put in any function. I forgot to put the print() function in front. By the function I finally got my answer ‘Hello world’!
