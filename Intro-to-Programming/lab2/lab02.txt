I have completed both of the lab tasks by using input(). 
The function input is a function that prints out the inputed information by the user. 
By following the specific rules I could easily complete the task. 

I first had the some problems with task B. 
Because I first inputed int(input) , but if you think about it, not all payments are integers when calculated in dollars. 
So I changed the int to float. 

To make the '+' work between, you have to put it as str(float(input))). You have to make it a string before you add it with other words. 

One unclear part was that I first used ',' when adding up words in print, so I didn't need to change all the inputs into string. What is the difference when using a comma and a plus sign.
