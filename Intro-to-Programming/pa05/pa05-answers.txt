C.1
Branching means using "if else" in python.
Which means that if the branch is True, it runs 
and when the if branch is False the else branch runs 

C.2
The assignment operator is the operator that is used to assign the result of the expression to the variable that is left to the operator, which is used with '=' 
And the equal-to comparison operator is an operator that checks whether the two expressions on both sides are equal or not using '=='. (A T/F statement comes out)

C.3
1) == (equals); if the values on both sides of operator are equal , the condition is true. 
2) != (not equal) ; if the values on both sides of operator are not equal , the condition is true.
3) > (greater than); if the value on the left is bigger than right side one , the condition is true.

C.4
To form a block of codes, you have to indent the code by the same whitespace 

C.5
You can use both. If using spaces , you should use four spaces 

C.6
You can't use an else statement by its own. 
It has to be used with an if statement 

C.7
No you have to use the structure in related conditions. 

C.8
In a function you have to indent the Docstrings, function body. Everything in the function has to be indented. (Except the definition(def function_name():, this does not need indentation)
