<tasks>
Wrote down the factorial function and a precise version with including the 0!. 
I wrote down a print_n function which prints out the string as much as the number inputed.
It was as same as the factorial function! 
I then wrote recursive functions!
Lastly I did some turtle drawing


I can't really understand how a function calls another function. 
For defining the do_n() I don't know how a object calls the function 
I understand that if do_n(a,n) is the function, 
You have to input a() to make it function , but how would you get the input of anything when you are using another function?
