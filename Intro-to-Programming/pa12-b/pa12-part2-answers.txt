1. 
For the class name, we need to use camelcase. We should use this, since this helps easier distinction between other functions. 

2.
__str__ is a magic method which provides a human readable representation. Since it is human readable, when using print() inside the codes, you can easily find out where the error is occurring. 
__repr__ is a magic method which provides a usable python representation of the object. Since this is a python readable output, we can easily distinguish the difference by using python codes when debugging.

3.
A magic method is a method that is automatically called by python where in predefined situations.

4.
We use class attributes when we have something that the class's object has in common. For example, when we define a class NikeShoes, we can have a class attribute like the brand name to be Nike. 

5.
No you can not assign a new value to a class attribute 
For example if you change the myBike1.total, the total for the whole class will not change.


6.
In default they are public. 

7.
To make attributes, methods private you should include __ in front of the method/attribute.
(Like __age)

8.
No, we can access the objects private attribute/methods through the class. By using getter, setter methods we can access private attributes. 

9.
If the object is updated outside of an object we might have some data damage. Making private attributes make the user to use methods to access them, not change them arbituarly.

10. 
When writing about private attributes/methods in definition, we need to always put __ in front, and also when writing the definition of the class, we could add information that the method, attribute is private in the docstring.


11.
You should not access the private attributes/methods outside of the class.
