# we're going to try if the following
# statement produces an output...

# it turns out that such a statement as ...
5 * 3
# ... is perfectly valid, although it
# won't generate any output on the screen.

# first definition of a variable
#  ( more will follow )
# a 'container' to store some information


# an 'assignment' (definition) in Python:
x = 5 * 3
# after the above assignment statement,
# the variable named  x  exists!

# another 'assignment' for the next variable:
# as every variable, it has:
# (1) a name ... in this case it's  y
# (2) a value ... in this case it's  2
# (3) a type ... in this case it's  integer
y = 2

# an equation in Python:
y == 3 * x
# ... as we tried in class, the above
# statement (i.e. an equation) won't be
# accepted by Python UNLESS we also
# define what are x and y

# the result of an equation in Python is ...
# ... a boolean (i.e. either True or False)
