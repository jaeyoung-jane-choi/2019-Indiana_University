5 + 3
# ... the above is a perfectly valid expression
#     but it won't generate screen output.

# here I'm going to define a variable named x:
x = 10 + 1 
# when the above statement is executed,
# Python does the following:
# 1. evaluates what's on the RHS (right of '=')
# 2. reserves some memory and stores the result
# 3. assigns a name to that memory.

# every variable has:
#  (1) a name - must be unique!
#  (2) a value 
#  (3) a integer type

# the following statement is
#   assigning the value (55 - 2) to the var. x
x = 55 - 2
# i.e. the '=' operation in Python
#      is called an 'assignment' operation


# here I'm going to define a variable named y:
y = 3



# an equation in Python:
y == x + 3
print( "I'm going to print the output of an equation, on the next line...")
print( "what is  y == x + 3  going to evaluate to...?")
print(  y == x + 3 )


# let's try different types:

floatingpoint = 3.1419

# we're going to define a variable
#   named   aStringVariable
#   with value   "the number pi is ..."
#   which will cause the type to be 'str'
aStringVariable = "the number pi is ..."
