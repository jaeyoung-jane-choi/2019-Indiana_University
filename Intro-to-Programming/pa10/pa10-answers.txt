To instantiate is to create an instance of an object in an object-oriented programming language.

A.4

Also we need to write a list of attributes it has. (This is the difference with functions)
We mention the name of the attribute and type, and what it represents  

A.5

But methods having self and without another parameter will work. 


A.6
Yes you can use the first parameter something other than self. 
What that parameter represents will always be the same whether it is self or not.
You would need to not use self, but the other name for places where self is.


A.7 

The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the object of a class
