1. nameError ; 
the name 'hi' is not defined since it is not a function installed in Python
-to print 'hi', we need to write down print('hi')

2. SyntaxError ; invalid syntax  
Using the same quotes makes the sentence end. So using the same quote 3 times closes the words between the first two quotes. 
-to print the sentence, we need to use different quotes. 

3. SyntaxError; EOL while scanning string literal
When Using different quotes, the sentence is not closed properly.
-use the same quote to close the sentence. 

4. SyntaxError; unexpected indent
When pressing tab in front, an error occurs. 
-start in the front of the line.

5. TypeError; unsupported operand type(s) for //: 'str' and 'int'
Inside the quotes, it can not be calculated by an integer.
-Delete the quotes, to make the numbers able in calculation. 

6. ZeroDivisionError; division by zero
When dividing a number by zero, Python can't calculate it. 
-Can't divide numbers by zero

2. 'Hello world' 

3. print("Hello world')
-When printed in the interactive shell, an error occurs and the error message is outputted. But when print in the script nothing is printed.
